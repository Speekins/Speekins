### Hi there! I'm Spencer (he/him). Thanks for stopping by!<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74210902/205475724-c57e074f-f70f-457a-8076-dad6d8f54287.gif" width="30" height="30"/>

![Hello](https://media.giphy.com/media/icUEIrjnUuFCWDxFpU/giphy.gif)

I'm currently a student in the front end engineering program at Turing School of Software & Design. My background professional experience includes project management in the homebuilding industry which required a lot of creativity (especially considering recent supply chain issues), excellent customer service & customer facing interactions, efficient time & schedule management, and an ability to communicate complex ideas to both customers and sub-contractors.
A couple of my greatest strengths include interpersonal/team work, and problem-solving. I consider myself an introverted personality type, but I really enhoy and prefer working and collaborating on teamsâ€”it gives me the opportunity to learn new and cool things from my teammates, and for us to build a better overall application. And I enjoy problem-solving in many aspects of my life from building a puzzle in my free-time, to solving home-improvement issues. I even struggle to pull myself away from a task (as my wife can attest) because I can't stop thinking about how to tackle a problem or improve a project!

#### What I'm Looking For
The next opportunity I'm looking is, as you guessed, to work on a team of developers building and improving the applications they build and maintain. My skillset leans toward front end technologies but I'm open to learning new concepts especially as I am familiar with a lot of the fundamentals of software engineering and very comfortable with anything JavaScript related.

#### Recent Projects
My most recent project is an application called Neatflix. [Check it out!](github.com/speekins/neatflix) It implements React and React Router to create a fantastically interactive web application. Cypress testing framework is also incorporated to test as many facets of the user experience as possible.

#### Current Projects
I'm currently looking at expanding on the Neatflix project by writing a simple backend API using Express.js and hosted on vercel. This will allow for more control of the information incorporated into the application and will even allow the user to sign in and see their own movie ratings!
